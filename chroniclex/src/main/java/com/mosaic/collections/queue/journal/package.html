A journal is a persisted series of events stored such that they can be replayed in the event of
needing to recover state.




<h2>Data File Format</h2>

The journal is stored across one or more data files.  The layout of the files is designed to be
append only, once an event is laid down in the file it will not be changed.  There is also no
meta information that tracks how many messages have been written and so forth, as this would cause
the hard drives to run slower.


<h3>Data File Layout</h3>

The journaled events are stored in the order that they were written, one after the other.  The first
data file is pre-allocated at a fixed size, this avoids costs in resizing the file as the events
are written.  When the first data file is full, another is created and writing continues.  Each
data file follows the same name convention, and are differentiated by a sequence number that starts
from zero and increments by one each time a new file is created.

<pre>
filename={serviceName}{seq}.data      // seq starts from zero, and increments by one each time a new data file is created

   journalVersion:ushort              // declares the version of the spec used to define the files layout
   msgCountSoFar:long                 // how many messages have preceded this point
                                      // NB at 100 million messages/sec, a long would take over 299 years to overflow
                                      // thus we can conclude that using a long for msgCountSoFar will be sufficient




   (payloadLength:int,payloadHashCode:int, payload:byte[])*  // the layout of each event, repeats zero or more times up to the end of the file
                                                             // stops when payloadLength is read as zero

</pre>


<h2>Inter Process Concurrency</h2>

The data files are designed to be accessed concurrently by multiple processes.  One writer, and
multiple readers.  This allows multiple systems to stay in sync with a single master and for
backups to happen concurrently without stalling the writer.  The multiple readers may be in the same
process as the writer, a different process on the same machine or on a remote machine.  This is made
possible by memory mapping the files, and ensuring that the data is synched between processes
and disk in a pre-determined order.  Thus ensuring that a partially written message is never
accessed by a reader.


<h3>The reader threads</h3>

Once an event has been 'flushed', it will never be changed.  Thus the reader threads must know how
far they are allowed to read in the list of ordered events, which is determined by the next message
having a hashCode of zero.


<h3>Protecting shared memory readers</h3>

The payload hashcode of a message will only be updated once the event is marked as complete,
which occurs when flush() is called on the writer.  Access to the variable must be protected by
a memory barrier to ensure that all data that was written up to that point becomes visible to
other processes at the appropriate time.


<h3>Protecting the events persisted to disk</h3>

The OS may write parts of the data files to disk at any time.  However we cannot be sure that
a message is on disk until we request a sync between memory and disk;  which is a relatively
expensive operation.  OS' will ensure that changes to memory mapped files are written to disk
before the file is closed, even if the process is killed.  However if the machine crashes or the
cleaner trips on the machines power cord, then data will be lost.

To protect against accidents, programmers may request a sync.  Usually done to ensure that the
event has been captures before reporting back to a user.  Every message is also immutable, so once
it is on disk it will never be changed and every event also includes a hashcode; so any corruption
of an event can be detected when it is read back.
