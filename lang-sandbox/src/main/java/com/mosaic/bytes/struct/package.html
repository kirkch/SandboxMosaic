  This package provides C like structures over com.mosaic.bytes.Bytes.

 Example usage:

 <pre>
public Account implements ByteFlyWeight {
    // Create a single registry for defining the fixed width struct.
    private static final StructRegistry structRegistry = new StructRegistry();
     
    // Register each of the struct's fields in turn;  the order will match the order that
    // the fields appear within the underlying bytes.  This only needs to be done once
    // per struct, and can be reused/shared.  Thus the registered fields are stored in
    // static final fields.
    private static final LongField       accountIdField = structRegistry.registerLong();
    private static final StringFieldUTF8 nameField      = structRegistry.registerUTF8Field(80);
 
    // the struct itself, it contains the actual data that we are interested in reading. It
    // is implemented as a flyweight that must be notified as to which bytes to use and is
    // used to get/set each field.  this design pattern was selected so that users have the
    // option to reduce object allocations by reusing objects without having to copy data over
    // and over.
    private Struct struct = structRegistry.createNewStruct();
 
 
    // example getter/setters
    public long getAccountId() {
        return accountIdField.get( struct );
    }
 
    public void setAccountId( long newId ) {
        accountIdField.set( struct, newId );
    }
 
 
    // Method declared on ByteFlyWeight, implement simply as a pass through to the struct
    // which also implements the same interface.  Thus the struct will be told which underlying
    // Bytes to use.
    public void setFlyWeightBytes( Bytes bytes, long base, long maxExc ) {
        this.struct.setFlyWeightBytes( bytes, base, maxExc );
    }
}
