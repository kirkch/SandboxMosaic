IO Structures are designed to be backed by disk.  In practice that means that the structures
are designed to work against byte arrays that have been memory mapped to a file.  Thus allowing
the OS to page them out to disk.  In Java this also means that the data structure can be
used off-heap, thus avoiding the overheads associated with garbage collection.
