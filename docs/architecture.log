    Settled on using -ea to turn on 'debug' mode.  It is weird at first to overload the JVM flag
    -ea; however by using it have a system wide way of stripping out debug code, whether we are
    using CLApp or not.  Other options included a K/V pair in System.properties, a CLApp flag,
    a compile time constant changed in the source code.  None of these alternatives would toggle
    the JVM assertions which is part of debugging.
