<h1>Object Arena<h1>
<p>
    A runtime environment for interacting objects. Arena adds the ability to persist objects, monitor and spread
    load across multiple CPU cores and machines while keeping overheads such as memory and cpu low.
</p>

<p>
    Objects interact with each other asynchronously through strongly typed proxy classes. As such managed objects must offer their
    functionality through an interface. Where each method on the feature interface must return either void or a Future.
    Every type referenced from the interface and stored within the managed object must be serializable.
</p>

<p>
    All interactions with the arena, such as registering new managed objects and looking them up by id is handled
    through an instance of Env. Managed objects gain access to Env by having a private transient field in their
    implementation. The runtime environment will set it, or unset it through the objects life cycle.
</p>

Managed objects must:
<ul>
    <li>Managed objects must provide their functionality via an interface, which will be used to proxy the object</li>
    <li>Methods on the Managed Objects interface must return either void or a Future</li>
    <li>Managed objects must be serializable</li>
    <li>Every argument passed through the managed objects interface must be serializable</li>
</ul>

Managed objects may:
<ul>
    <li>Managed objects may access their runtime by having a private transient field called env and of type Env.</li>
    <li>Managed objects may store references to other managed objects safely. However the references could be safely unlinked by the runtime.</li>
</ul>

Managed objects should not:
<ul>
    <li>Create/manage threads</li>
    <li>Synchronize or use other concurrency controls</li>
    <li>Persist themselves to disk</li>
    <li>Manage network IO</li>
    <li>Block the calling thread</li>
</ul>
