The goal of this package is to provide tools for creating push parsers that support non-blocking streams of input data.
This is achieved by maintaining a state machine of the parsing that can be paused and resumed at any time. The state
machine is encoded within an immutable set of classes that create new instances of themselves in response to input. This
approach helps to simplify the handling of characters that can come in fits and bursts without blocking the parsing
thread and reduces the boiler plate needed to maintain mark points in streams. Simpler blocks of code are then easier
to understand, maintain, test and tune.<p/>

The first class to look at to start understanding how push parsing works is com.mosaic.parsers.push.Matcher.
