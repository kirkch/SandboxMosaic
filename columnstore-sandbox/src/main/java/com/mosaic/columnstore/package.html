This package contains classes for modelling a spreadsheet, complete with formulas.  The spreadsheets
are modelled as columns.  This can be a more flexible approach than storing by row, as each column
may be be stored in multiple groups and processed separately.<p/>


<h2>Caching</h2>

This package works best when the rows are added incrementally, and previous rows are never modified
or removed.  That is to say, any updates or deletes occur by inserting a new row.  This approach
maximises the potential for caching cells that are costly to calculate on the fly.  If updates are
allowed, then either do not cache at all or take care to update the caches to maintain correct
values.  For this reason, none of the columns cache automatically.  Caching is only done when
explicitely requested.


<h2>Parallelism</h2>

This package expects to be called from a single thread at a time.  The column implementations
aim to maximise CPU cache hits when iterating over the rows of a column.
